# [S021](/asleep)

A story by Enrique García and Juanjo Bazán

Earth, Solar System


## Asleep

... <small>beep</small> <small>beep</small> beep beep beep beep BEEP BEEP BEEP **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

Time to [Wake up](/bed)


## Bed

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

The alarm woke you up, but your eyes are still closed.

Your first insticts are to either [turn off the alarm](/turn-alarm-off) or [open your eyes](/open-eyes#open-eyes).


## [turn-alarm-off]("Bed")

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

- EDDIE, turn off alarm
- <span class="eddie">Request not compatible with previously arranged parameters. I'm sorry.</span>

You forgot that you instructed EDDIE to keep beeping the alarm until you [opened your eyes](/open-eyes#open-eyes).

It occurs to you that you can try to [fuck around with EDDIE](/get-up) today, instead.


## [open-eyes]("Bed")

You open your eyes.

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** (The alarm stops)

- <span class="eddie">Good morning S021, did you sleep well?</span>
- [It was fine](/get-up)


## [get-up](?open-eyes "Crew's quarters")

You leave your bunk bed. It's the only used bed in a group of 4. The "quarters" is a very small
room which holds these bunkbeds and a small crew restroom.

You have a bad taste in your mouth and want to pee.

[Go to the restroom](/restroom?open-eyes)

## [get-up]("Crew's quarters")

You have decided to keep your eyes shut just to test EDDIE.

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

You leave your bunk bed, without opening your eyes. Will it acknowledge that you woke up?

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

Apparently not. The alarm keeps going off.

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

You need to [use the restroom](/hurt-knee)

## [hurt-knee]("Ouch!")

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

You try to get to the restroom without opening your eyes.

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP**

Unfortunately you didn't calculate your trayectory quite right, and hit one of the bunkbeds with your knee.

The pain makes you involuntarily open your eyes.

**BEEP** **BEEP** **BEEP** (The alarm stops)

- <span class="eddie">Good morning S021, did you sleep well?</span>

What. A. Prick.

[Go to the restroom](/restroom), awkardly covering your knee with one hand.

## Restroom

The crew's restroom barely qualifies as a "room".

It is an exercise in pragmatism. A single central unit takes care of all the business.
It's shower function doubles as the self-cleaning function.

Even so, you feel better after using it.

And hungry. You head to the galley.
