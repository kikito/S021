## S021

## Guidelines:

1. No pressure. If it takes time, it takes time. We are doing this for fun.
2. One author makes a PR, then the other one reviews, approves, and makes their own PR.
3. No limit in how big or how small every PR is.
4. "Spoilers" (notes that can help reviewing/approving/collaborating) are ok in PR descriptions. But part of the fun in this exercise is getting into unknown waters.
5. This is similar to an improv class. The review spirit should be **YES, AND**. But it is ok in a review to point out things like:
  * Ortography/grammar
  * Inconsistencies (i.e. it is already specified that this thing is called foo, not bar)
6. Once a PR is accepted the new version should appear in http://kikito.github.io/S021
7. Javascript is allowed but let's try to keep it to a tasteful minimum. Same with fancy CSS.

These are **guidelines**, not rules, and we can change them or extend them as we wish.
